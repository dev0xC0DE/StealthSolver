## üõ† Installation

### ü™ü Windows Guide (.exe)

####  Download the Application  
- Visit the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Anurag-Varma/StealthSolver/releases) page.  
- Download the latest version of the application (e.g., `StealthSolver.zip`).  

####  Extract Files  
- Locate the downloaded `StealthSolver.zip` file in your **Downloads** folder.  
- Extract it to a directory of your choice.  

####  Run the Application  
- Open the extracted folder and double-click `StealthSolver.exe` to launch the application.  

####  Firewall & Antivirus Configuration (Hotfix)  
- If prompted, allow the application through **Windows Firewall** to ensure smooth operation.  
- Sometimes, **Microsoft Defender or other antivirus software** may flag the application as a potential threat. If this happens:  
  - Temporarily **disable** Microsoft Defender or your antivirus.  
  - **Whitelist** `StealthSolver.exe` in your antivirus settings.  
- The application is **not a virus**, but it may be incorrectly flagged as the `.exe` is made using pyinstaller without a verfied signature.

### üêç Python Installation

#### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9 or above** is required, can be installed from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ "python.org")
  - Verify your Python version:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

#### Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anurag-Varma/StealthSolver.git
cd StealthSolver
```

#### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3.9 -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

#### Install Dependencies

The repository contains a `requirements.txt` file, which lists the required Python packages. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Verify Installation

Check that all dependencies are installed correctly by running any test scripts or commands provided in the repository:

```bash
python main.py
```

#### Build the Application (Optional)

If you want to build a standalone `.exe` file for the application, you can use the `pyinstaller` tool. Run the following command:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --name "StealthSolver" --icon=assets/logo.ico --add-data "assets/logo128.png;assets" main.py
```

This command will create a single executable file named `StealthSolver.exe` in the `dist` directory.

By following these steps, you can set up and run the **StealthSolver** project, or optionally build a standalone `.exe` file.
