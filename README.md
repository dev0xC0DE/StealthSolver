## üõ† Installation

### ü™ü Windows Guide (.exe)

1. ####  Download the Application  
    - Visit the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Anurag-Varma/StealthSolver/releases) page.  
    - Download the latest version of the application (e.g., `StealthSolver.zip`).  

2. ####  Extract Files  
    - Locate the downloaded `StealthSolver.zip` file in your **Downloads** folder.  
    - Extract it to a directory of your choice.  

3. ####  Run the Application  
    - Open the extracted folder and double-click `StealthSolver.exe` to launch the application.  

4. ####  Firewall & Antivirus Configuration (Hotfix)  
    - If prompted, allow the application through **Windows Firewall** to ensure smooth operation.  
    - Sometimes, **Microsoft Defender or other antivirus software** may flag the application as a potential threat. If this happens:  
      - Temporarily **disable** Microsoft Defender or your antivirus.  
      - **Whitelist** `StealthSolver.exe` in your antivirus or Microsoft Defender settings.  [See the tutorial](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/add-or-remove-exclusions-for-microsoft-defender-antivirus-in-windows-11.8797/)
    - The application is **not a virus**, but it may be incorrectly flagged as the `.exe` is made using pyinstaller without a verfied signature.

### üêç Python Installation

1. #### Prerequisites

    **Python 3.9 or above** is required, can be installed from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ "python.org")
   
      Verify your Python version:
   
      ```bash
      python --version
      ```
      or
      ```bash
      python3 --version
      ```

3. #### Clone the Repository

    Open a terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anurag-Varma/StealthSolver.git
    cd StealthSolver
    ```

3. #### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

    Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
  
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       python -m venv env
       env\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       python3.9 -m venv env
       source env/bin/activate
       ```

4. #### Install Dependencies

    The repository contains a `requirements.txt` file, which lists the required Python packages. Install them using pip:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. #### Verify Installation

    Check that all dependencies are installed correctly by running any test scripts or commands provided in the repository:
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

6. #### Build the Application (Optional)

    If you want to build a standalone `.exe` file for the application, you can use the `pyinstaller` tool. Run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --name "StealthSolver" --icon=assets/logo.ico --add-data "assets/logo128.png;assets" main.py
    ```
    
    This command will create a single executable file named `StealthSolver.exe` in the `dist` directory.

By following these steps, you can set up and run the **StealthSolver** project, or optionally build a standalone `.exe` file.
